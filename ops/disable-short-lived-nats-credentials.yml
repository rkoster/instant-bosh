# Disable short-lived NATS bootstrap credentials for Docker environments
# 
# By default, BOSH uses short-lived bootstrap credentials for security.
# This causes a 49-second delay during VM creation while waiting for
# permanent credentials to be synchronized via bosh-nats-sync.
#
# In Docker environments where the security attack vector doesn't apply,
# we can disable this feature to eliminate the delay.
#
# With this disabled:
# - VMs receive permanent NATS credentials immediately
# - No update_settings step needed after initial ping
# - VM creation completes in ~5-10 seconds instead of ~55 seconds
