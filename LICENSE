                      The Licensed Work is © 2025 Ruben Koster
Additional Use Grant: Use of the Licensed Work is permitted for any purpose, provided the user is not
                      a Large-Scale Commercial Entity, as defined below. Use of the Licensed Work is
                      also permitted by the Cloud Foundry Foundation and its sponsored projects, subject
                      to the limitations below.

                      Definition of "Large-Scale Commercial Entity":
                      A "Large-Scale Commercial Entity" is any entity (including its affiliates and
                      subsidiaries) whose aggregate annual gross revenue for the most recently completed
                      fiscal year is equal to or greater than $1,000,000,000 USD (One Billion US
                      Dollars).

                      Prohibited Activities for Large-Scale Commercial Entities:
                      The rights granted under the general BSL and the Additional Use Grant do not
                      include the following activities for a Large-Scale Commercial Entity:
                      1. Redistribution for a Fee: Redistributing the Licensed Work, or any derivative
                      works of the Licensed Work, to a third party for a fee, regardless of whether that
                      fee is bundled with other services or products.
                      2. Internal Production Use: Any internal production use of the Licensed Work for
                      the ordinary course of the entity's business.

                      Specific Exemption and Limitation for Cloud Foundry Foundation:
                      The restrictions against Internal Production Use and Redistribution in (1) and (2)
                      above do not apply to the Cloud Foundry Foundation or any of its sponsored
                      projects, subject to the following limitations:

                      1.  **Limited Permitted Use:** The Cloud Foundry Foundation and its sponsored
                      projects are strictly limited to using the Licensed Work for non-production
                      purposes, including, but not limited to, testing, documentation, quality assurance,
                      integration, and collaborative development.
                      2.  **No Redistribution:** The Cloud Foundry Foundation and its sponsored projects
                      are expressly prohibited from redistributing the Licensed Work in any form.
                      3.  **Developer Carve-Out:** Notwithstanding the definition of "Large-Scale
                      Commercial Entity," any individual developer is permitted to use the Licensed Work
                      for the sole purpose of contributing code, documentation, or other assets directly
                      to a project governed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation, provided that such use is
                      non-production and is consistent with the Foundation's own contribution and
                      licensing policies. This exception does not permit the Large-Scale Commercial
                      Entity to use the Licensed Work internally or redistribute it for commercial
                      purposes.
Change Date:          Four years from the date the Licensed Work is published.
Change License:       Apache License, Version 2.0
